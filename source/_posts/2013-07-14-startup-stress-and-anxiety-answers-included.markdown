Much has been written about startup stress [here](http://spencerfry.com/startups-stress-and-depression) and [here](http://maplebutter.com/how-to-deal-7-strategies-to-keep-your-stress-in-check-when-running-a-start-up/) and the solution is what Justin Rosenstein of Asana calls a ["willful intention with a nonconcern for results"](http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=3117)

Despite this problem being seemingly solved, we get posts like My Startup has 30 Days to Live. So here's some tangential advice:


   * Every minute spent on something other than your startup is a minute you could blankly stare at your Mac
   * Exercising is healthy. But eating is even healthier.
   * Stop reading TechCrunch and any industry news not directly related to your business
   * Thinking you're not being productive enough makes you less productive
   * Impostor Syndrome(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) is a real thing
   * Go big AND go home. Occasionally.
   * If you lie, believe it, stand behind it and move on. Saves you time.
   * Every high has an imminent low. Use every friend, family member, or acquaintance conversation to refuel your social energy and get out of the low ASAP
   * Sleep on airplanes. Only.
   * Looking at other startups is like reading People. Waste of time.
   * Before you doubt something, make sure you had your normal dose of caffeine
   * No matter how bad it gets, it can't be as bad as <insert "Color" equivalent in your space>
   * Listen to this TWiST episode with Jerry Colonna (or watch the Steve Jobs video again)


That's it for now.
