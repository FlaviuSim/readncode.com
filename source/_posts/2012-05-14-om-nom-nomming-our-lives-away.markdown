That's Pickles, the panda responsible for any down-time at the
quasi-legal music playing website, <a target="blank"

This all started with the Cookie Monster's voracious appetite for
cookies on Sesame Street. Find out how "om nom nom" progressed to
singing cats and rabbits on the internet <a target="blank"

There is even a website called <a target="blank"
href="http://omnomnomnom.com">omnomnomnom.com</a>, with pictures such as
this: <img src="http://readncode.com/media/images/blog/blimp.jpg" />

Naturally, the more "nom"s after the "om", the more enjoyable the act.
The same applies to adding an "r" at the very beginning to emphasize the
initial bite.

Further, as urbandictionary hints at <a target="blank"
href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=nomming">here</a>,
"nomming" has also come to mean kissing or nibbling in a romantic
setting.

Perhaps it was the confusion of its use (as well as its correct
spelling) that led to the Yelp Austin community outcry, <a
target="blank" href="http://www.yelp.com/topic/austin-can-we-please-kill-nom-nom">"Can
we please kill Nom Nom?"</a>

I think we have a harder time expressing ourselves than ever before, and
meaningless interjections such as "rom nom" often come to our rescue.
