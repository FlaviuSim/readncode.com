Two of the events above made the Renaissance possible.

Renaissance is when architects changed from unnoticed hardworking ants
to egomaniacs like Howard Roark. Why? Because they realized man is at
the center of everything (see DaVinci's Vitruvian Man below), especially
the interpretation of the divine.

Pope Julius II really liked art, so he kept Bramante, Raphael,
Michelangelo, and others on the payroll. Michelangelo never got to see
his St. Peter Cathedral built.

None of DaVinci's plans ever got built before or after he died. I guess
it could be worse.

Interesting fact is that this guy named Andrea Palladio is the most
copied architect ever. He started making villas, expensive homes for rich people to chill in for the summer. Now, pretty much every upscale neighborhood in the U.S., England, or Russia mirrors his designs.

Then came Baroque, which tried get away from all straight lines.
Architects started using cinema (Quentin Tarantino?) for their
inspiration. I mean, look at this:

So, naturally, the Germans and French thought it was a race towards
decadence, so Louis XIV (Insane) built Versailles and even coined the
word **Rococo** at his court. It basically means "tons of gilded plaster
and mirrors."

That's it for this week. Hope you enjoyed it.
