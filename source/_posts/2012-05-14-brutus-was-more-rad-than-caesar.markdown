"_The fault, dear Brutus, lies not in our stars, but in ourselves_"  says George Clooney with a smirk in  _Intolerable Cruelty (2003)_ (a lesser known Coen brothers film).

You never hear George Clooney recite Chaucer:

<code>He was an easy man in penance-giving
Where he coul dhope to make a decent living</code>

Shakespeare, on the other hand, influences us every day. [Harold Bloom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Bloom) claims all writers after Shakespeare live in a constant anxiety of his influence.

I imagine [T.S. Eliot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T.s._eliot) reading in _Julius Caesar_:

<code>I have seen tempests when the scolding winds
Have riv'd the knotty oaks, and I have seen
Th' ambitious ocean swell, and rage, and foam</code>

And then I imagine him writing his famous _[Prufrock](http://www.bartleby.com/198/1.html)_:

<code>I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker</code>

I decided to read _Julius Caesar_ to escape my own anxiety with doing a startup. The written play comes to life more vividly than Avatar in blu-ray.

I admire Brutus more than Caesar. As Mark Antony remarks after Brutus' death,

<code>He was the noblest Roman of them all:
[...]
His life was gentle, and the elements
So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
And say to all the world, This was a man!</code>

Furthermore, when Cassius threatens him, Brutus replies:

<code>There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats;
For I am arm'd so strong in honesty
That they pass by me as the idle wind,
Which I respect not. [...]</code>

Instead of backing down, Brutus raises all-in, and Cassius folds. Baller.

My favorite quote (Brutus' objection to Caesar's ambition) rings so similar to the [Occupy Wall Street Message](http://occupywallst.org/):

<code>Th' abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
Remorse from power</code>

Here's a good quote to end on from our dear Brutus when Cassius tries to convince him to kill Caesar:

<code>I love the name of honor more than I fear death.</code>
