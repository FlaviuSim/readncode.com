<p></p>Yesterday, I read Eric Ries' *The Lean Startup*.

This ADHD book invites you on an imaginary roller coaster of undigested thoughts. 

So, who is Eric Ries? Who is John Galt? Oh, that's a [different blog post](http://readncode.com/blog/why-i-hate-ayn-rand/).

You don't know who he is? He founded **[imvu.com](http://imvu.com)**!!!

That's pronounced "Aye am view" or "aye am vee you". Not sure. Anyway, they make 3D Avatars. 

Instead of cropping your ex-gf from a facebook profile picture, you can now just use a **[Sin City](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401792/)** look-alike of Bruce Willis.

It turns out his biggest accomplishment in the Startup world is writing a book about Startups. Lean.

Eric Ries is proof that **[Jean Baudrillard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baudrillard)** was right. The signifier has replaced the signified. He is a **[simulacrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation)** of an entrepreneur.

How do I really feel about it?

A lean startup is like a lean burger. Really healthy. Everyone says it's what you should do. But it tastes awful.

Build a product in 2 hours, sell it in 4, be a billionaire by lunch, or start over. But the truth is (as I am finding out) that's bullshit. Startups are all about the fat.

I think spending 2 days on a button's CSS is frustrating and unproductive, yet necessary and rewarding. 

Deciding which 20% of fat to keep is what really matters.

**"Build. Measure. Learn."**

a.k.a.

Build. But first, read this book. Then, build, or better, don't. Find a way not to build. Hell, just admit you have a terrible idea. Repeat.

So, dear Eric, as you type the imminent sequel, please make it less than 336 pages, stop forcing corporate examples for your Bain & Company skimmers, and please, Eric, **be phat.**
