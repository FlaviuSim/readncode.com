A founder or a startup CEO most resembles a courtesan.

Both journeys start with anxiety and uneasiness about asking for a stranger's money. And you aim low because you fear rejection.

It starts with coffee and late lunches. With 400k on a 2 million valuation. They balk, and ask for more. Too small for our fund. (That's what she said)

But you hit some numbers, generate some buzz, you raise the price and the amount. Eventually it moves to dinners and early breakfasts, and long phone conversations, lawyers and term sheets. 1.5 on a 7. No, on a 5. With 5 board seats and an observer. (what's an observer anyway? Would a courtesan agree to that?)

Months go by and, while prostituting can be fun and money gives you a RedBull rush, eventually the Taurine ain't what it was.

Experts say you should raise as much money as you can get. I suggest you ask for as little as you need. Build your business. If you like raising money, work for a bank. Or a charity.

Budgeting to meet goals and running out of money is a more valuable lesson than dilution and arguing over board seats. Also, you don't really need that much money anyway. Remember: $1 from a customer is worth $10 from an investor. 

What courtesan accepts Bolivars?
