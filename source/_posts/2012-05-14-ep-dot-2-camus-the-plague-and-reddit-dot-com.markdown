In this show, I catch up on some of the feedback and announce the brand new website, http://readncode.com. Then, I dive into Existentialism, what it is, and what Camus' relationship to it was. 

I briefly summarize plot of The Plague, and cite a few representative short lines. I look at some of the popular entries on the news site reddit.com, in particular the programming (proggit) part of this site. 

Finally, I attempt to draw some connections between quotes from the novel and links submitted to reddit.
