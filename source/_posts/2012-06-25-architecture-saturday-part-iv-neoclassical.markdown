Sometime in the 18th century, architects reacted against the Rococo
([previous blog post](/blog/2012/05/26/architecture-saturday-part-iii-renaissance)) and turned towards the classic Greek and Roman styles with a touch of Renaissance (Andrea Palladio).

Andrea Palladio is the most influential architect ever, with an
architects fanclub started long after his death called "The Palladians."

Actually, one could say that the official architecture style of the
United States is "Andrea Palladio". Thomas Jefferson got a crush on it
when he was an ambassador in France. Snobs call it "Classicism."

Here's Palladio's "Villa Rotunda":

Here's Jefferson's home (Monticello) near Charlottesville, VA, which he
architected:

Jefferson also designed University of Virginia's Library after
the Roman Pantheon:

Hell, even the White House, Lincoln Memorial, and the Capitol were greatly influenced by
Andrea Palladio (not to mention every upscale neighborhood).

Neoclassical also made some advances in garden design, from the stodgy,
perfect-looking Versailles garden, to the English Garden designed by
Charles Bridgeman:

Bridgeman invented the "ha-ha" which, besides being the coolest
Architectural term ever, serves as a trench that you do not
notice from a distance, but that keeps neighbors' animals from wandering
in your really expensive garden:

The Neoclassical era was also a time of Napoleonic grandeur and aspirations
of taking over the world. No wonder Etienne Louis Boulle designed this
thing:

St. Pancras in London even made caryatids as columns coppying the
Caryatid Porch of the Erechtheion on the Acropolis at Athens:

Of course, no one really knows what purpose these maidens served in the
original architecture. But they look cool.

The Germans stepped up their game during the Neoclassical period by
building things such as the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, built originally
as a sign of peace, but came in handy during Berlin's devided
political struggles:

Karl Friedrich Shinkel designed the gate and many other museums in
Berlin that look like the Parthenon.

Perhaps the most innovation in the Neoclassical period came from Russia,
where Catherine the Great began the Hermitage as her personal art
collection:

Despite "hosting" Napoleon in Moscow for a little while, the Russian
elite spoke French and their imperial architecture was greatly
influenced by the French gentleness:
