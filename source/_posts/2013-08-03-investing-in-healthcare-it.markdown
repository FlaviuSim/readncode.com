There is a spectre haunting healthcare IT â€” the specter of
investor skittishness.

I am here to tell you they are wrong. Not just because I lead [a
healthcare IT startup](http://iMedicare.com). But because the
recent [Rock Health
report](http://www.slideshare.net/RockHealth/2013-midyear-digital-health-funding-by-rockhealth-23728823) is showing investors shorting healthcare IT.

Supposedly there hasn't been a billion dollar exit. So VCs
hesitate. Which makes it a great time to buy. Why?

1. Seed stage healthcare IT companies are undervalued.
2. The current redistribution of revenues in healthcare will have some winners and losers. You want to pick the winners.
3. Investing in 10 healthcare IT companies is less risky than
buying 10 houses. The number of companies is very low and you have a few accelerators vetting and doing all the work for you.
4. You stand more of a chance of changing the world in a meaningful way than the rest of your portfolio does. That's got to matter, right?
