Let us go then, me and I,  
When the seed stage stretches out against the sky  
Like a student etherized  
By college education;  
Let us go through certain half-deserted meetups,  
Twitterring retweets  
Of restless nights in one night cheap hotels  
For sapless conferences we pay to pitch  
The uninformed bravado comments  
Of insidious intent  
To lead you to an overwhelming question...  
Oh, do not ask, "Is it on Android?"  
Let us go and build our product.  

In the room, associates come and go  
Talking of startup deal flow  

And indeed there will be time  
To wonder "do I dare?" and "do I dare?"  
Will I make your partners billionaires?  
With a three to five year plan that scales—  
(They will say "His distribution channel's thin!")  
My user base, my cost to bring them in  
Retention rich and modest, but engagement like LinkedIn.  
(They will say, "How his team is very green!")  
Do I dare  
Disturb the universe?  
In a minute there is time  
For the pivots and re-pivots that a board room will reverse.  

In the room, associates come and go  
Talking of startup deal flow  

For I have emailed them already, boomeranged them all:  
Jigsawed sales in evenings, mornings, afternoons,  
Burn rate measured out in coffee spoons.  
I know the startups dying with a dying fall  
Beneath the Entrepreneurship Thought Leaders  
and the Calacanis from a farther room.  

And would it have been worth it, after all,  
Would it have been worth the opportunity cost,  
After the Series A round, and the B  
After preparing the report, after the board room scuffle  
And this, and so much more? —  
It is impossible to sell just what we have!  

But as if a magic CFO threw revenues in patterns in Excel:  
Would it have been worth the license  
If one, boarding Virgin Airlines, or checking in the W,  
And turning towards the black car, should say:  
"That is not it all,  
That does not scale, at all."  

No! I am not Mark Suster, nor was meant to be;  
Am an un-blogging soul, one that will do  
To send a term sheet, book a flight or two,  
Advise the founder; no doubt, an easy tool,  
Deferential, glad to make an intro,  
Visionary, skeptic, and meticulous;  
Full of disruptive revolution  
At times, indeed, almost ridiculous  
Almost, at times, the Foo.
