*[@talkible](http://twitter.com/talkible)* won. I was fortunate to be a part of this great team. 

Lessons Learned:

1. Teams of 8 don't have to suck.
-------
We had 4 business-oriented teammates and 4 code-oriented ones. Everyone helped out in a cohesive manner and felt as one. I've never seen that before.

2 days is enough to validate an idea. Not if you read [hackernews](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2558005), of course.
---------

3. ninja developers can't hurt. 
------------
We had awesome developers, but other teams did too. I think we kept developers focused on each task to be, as one admitted, "the most productive they've ever been."

4. Be a nice asshole.
--------------------
Sure, you want all team members to pitch in. But you need to make a call between good and bad wireframes, designs, and CSS. They'll learn.

5. Marketing/Business fluff matters. 
-----------------------
Researching competitors, strategies, consumer perception, and refining the pitch may sound worthless to you, but it's the car paint of your product. Would you buy a rusty brown ferrari?
