Ayn Rand is who I think of when I hear Billy Joel sing:

*"She can ruin your faith with her casual lies*

*And she only reveals what she wants you to see*

*She hides like a child but **she's always a woman to me**"*

The above summarizes Objectivism better than wikipedia ever could.

Atlas Shrugged == a pop novel feigning depth. At least the Fountainhead
has a catchy start. But let's face it, they're all literary dung. Why?

1.   She chooses words carelessly for shock value:
-----------------------
*"The clouds and the shafts of skyscrapers were brown, like an old painting in oil, the color of a fading masterpiece."*

Seriously?

There is no meaning here. Move along.


2. tl;dr

3. If you have to justify your characters' realness on the first page of Atlas Shrugged, a rewrite is due.
----------------------

*"I trust that no one will tell me that men such as I write about don't exist. That this book has been written--and published*[alas]*--is my proof that they do"*

4. Ayn Rand justifying Objectivism over Altruism is like Satan selling someone on Hell:

5. <u>[Here's](http://www.theawl.com/2011/04/when-alan-met-ayn-atlas-shrugged-and-our-tanked-economy)</u> someone blaming the recession on Ayn Rand.
-----------------------------

Can we also blame the Japanese Earthquake on her? And empty paper towel
dispensers?

6: So, before you spawn more emo kids with a rational self-interest (as opposed to an irrational self-interest?) read this:

Seriously though, make sure your kids only read Ayn Rand when they're happy.
