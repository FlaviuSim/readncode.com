{% blockquote %} TL;DR: 1. Stop reading this post {% endblockquote %}

When Lebron practices, what motivates him? He’s already better than anyone out there.

Is it another championship? Maybe? Staying ahead of KD? Most definitely not.

Compete with another and eventually you might just beat them all. Then what?

Set a lofty goal and you might just attain it. Then what?

The lofty goal you set becomes your downfall. Should you set a loftier goal? No.

As Jarod Kintz puts it “What does it mean to be the best? It means you have to be better than the number two guy. But what gratification is there in that? He's a loser—that’s why he's number two.” 

Instead, compete against yourself. That way you’ll win the battles but never the war. The never-ending war of self-improvement.

Anyway, stop reading here. Go back to work. Reading about productivity is counterproductive.
