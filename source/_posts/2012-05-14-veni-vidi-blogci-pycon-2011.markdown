Pycon is the Python Conference that you should check out <a target=blank href="http://us.pycon.org">here</a>. Why? Because the 1400 nicest smart developers attend it every year.

It was so awesome that after being there for tutorials (Django Deployment, Web Scraping, Sphinx) and the conference days, I decided on a whim to stay for the sprints, which are 4 days of working with great developers on open source projects such as Django, pip, rtfd, and Flask.

I personally got some great friends out of it, along with a renewed excitement for contributing to open source.
