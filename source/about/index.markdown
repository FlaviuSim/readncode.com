Hello. I'm <a href="{{ site.author-url }}">Flaviu Simihaian</a> (flah-vee-yoo soe-me-hi-yon).

I was born in [Nasaud, Romania](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=nasaud,+romania&hl=en&ie=UTF8&hnear=Nasaud,+Bistri%C8%9Ba-N%C4%83s%C4%83ud+County,+Romania&t=m&z=13) and moved to Concord, NC when I was 14 to play tennis and
attend school. I have a B.A. in Economics from <a
href="http://davidson.edu">Davidson College</a> and an M.S. in Software
Design and Engineering from <a href="http://uncc.edu">UNC Charlotte</a>.

I currently live in Charlotte NC and I freelance Ruby on Rails,
Python/Django, JavaScript, and iOS (Native) Development. 

I am the founder of <a
href="http://eval.me">eval.me</a>, a web survey company, and <a
href="http://flavma.com">Flavma Inc.</a>, a Pharmacy Software company
that made [iMedicare](http://twitter.com/iMedicare), the first Medicare Part D Plan
Finder for the iPad. I am a [Rotarian](http://rotary.org) and was
president of the [Charlotte University City Rotary Club](http://ucrotary.com) in 2011-2012.

I am also involved with the local tech community, having started
the [Python and Django Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/python-django-charlotte/) and help out with the [Charlotte Ruby Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/charlotte-rb/) and [Charlotte Grok](http://www.charlottegrok.com/).

When I'm not coding/entrepreneuring, I memorize poetry, golf, read the New Yorker, 
cook, and volunteer.
